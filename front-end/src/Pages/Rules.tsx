                2023 Austin-Bangladeshi Volleyball Tournament Rules, Version 2
            </div>


            The rules of play for the tournament will be governed by the following:

            Players will participate in the tournament in the spirit of sportsmanship and will conduct
            themselves in the best manner possible.

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Communication:
            </div>

            Games will be refereed by volunteer and/or paid tournament officials. All calls by the
            officials are final. No arguing. It’s for fun! In no circumstances, players are allowed to taunt,
            abuse, or hit the referees of the game. Such player(s) will be immediately thrown out of the
            game.

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Draft:
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                Each captain will rank the other 19 captains (except himself) starting from Rank 1 (most skillful), 2, 3,…, 19 (least skillful). An average ranking will develop for each captain out of the ranking numbers assigned.
                
                The lowest average number will be the No. 1 captain and highest average number will be the No. 20 captain.
                                
                The ranking process should be extremely confidential, so the Org Committee requested Tarek (a non-captain member of the Org Committee), to prepare the average ranking. Each captain will send their ranking to Tarek individually and Tarek will publish only the average ranking to the Captains Group.
                                
                Now, for the first-round and second-round picks, the total 20 captains will be put in two separate buckets: Bucket 1 will consist of No.1 through No. 10 captains (stronger captains) and Bucket 2 will consist of No. 11 through No. 20 captains (weaker captains).
                                
                For the first-round picks, Bucket 2 captains will have the lottery for 1-10 picks and Bucket 1 captains will have the lottery for 11-20 picks.
                               
                For the second-round picks, the order will be reversed. Bucket 1 captains will have the lottery for 1-10 picks and Bucket 2 captains will have the lottery for 11-20 picks.
                                
                                
                From the third-round, the typical lottery and snake rule will apply.

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Rule of the Game:
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>1.</b>   It is preferable that each group game starts & finishes in parallel.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>2.</b> The server has 10 seconds to begin the serve from the time the official signals the serve.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>3.</b> Referee will have a flag & not whistle; to avoid audio-confusion. So be mindful to serve/receive upon the signal of the ref.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>4.</b> During the first-round and the second-round games, each game will be played to 25 points. 
                There will be no side-out. Each service will constitute a point. 
                Court-swap after reaching 12 points by any team. 
                This is to be fair with light/court orientation advantage/disadvantage. 
                The semi-finalists and the finalists will play a maximum of three consecutive games at each level with 25 (first game), 25 (second game), and 15 (third game) points. 
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>5.</b> If the score is 24-24 or 14-14 by any case, the deciding factor would be whoever gets to 25 or 15 first, respectively. This is made to
                finish the games within the allotted times from the venue.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>6.</b> After the first-round games, four teams from each group will advance to the second round and after the second-round games two teams from each group will advance to the semi-final. 
                The second-round teams and the semi-finalists will be determined based on the highest number of games won by each team. 
                If two or more teams end up winning the same number of games, then the team having more point difference i.e., 
                points scored minus points against, moves to the semifinal. For example, if the scores for Team A are: 
                25-21, 25- 20, 25-10, 24-25, 23-25, and 15-25; and the scores for Team B are: 25-20, 25-19, 25-19, 20- 25, 24-25, and 20-25; 
                then the sum of point difference for Team A is 11 (=4+5+15-1-2-10) and the sum of point difference for Team B is 6 (=5+6+6-5-1-5). 
                Based on this example, Team A will go to the next round. If the point difference also becomes equal, 
                then a 15-point game will be played between the two teams and the winner will move to the next round.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>7.</b> Game officials will track server serial (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Players must rotate clockwise at
                every new service to allow all the players an equal opportunity for the location advantages.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>8.</b> While the ball is on the air, players can change their locations if they wish (generally the way we play every week here in Austin);
                however, in no cases a player from the second row should take a constant place at the net while the ball is on the air.
                Let’s make the tournament more enjoyable to everyone.

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>9.</b> A “let” serve that clears the net is considered acceptable.
                A “let” serve in volleyball occurs when the delivered ball hits the top of the net,
                but still makes it over the net and to the opponent’s side.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>10.</b> The server’s feet may not touch/cross the court lines until the ball is released (while serving);
                otherwise his team will lose a point.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>11.</b> A team is allowed one minimum and three maximum successive contacts to return the ball.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>12.</b> A block is allowed in the games. After blocking, the same player can hit the ball again
                (i.e., in this case one person can touch the ball two times successively,
                once during blocking and then after the blocking is done).
                After blocking maximum 3 more contacts can be made by the blocking team while the ball is on the blocking side.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>13.</b>  A five-member rule committee will provide further clarification to referees if need be and
                their decision will be final.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>14.</b> A ball is out if it touches the antenna, the post, side structure/screen, or the roof/roof
                features. A ball is also out if it comes outside of the antenna.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>15.</b> Any part of the body is allowed for returning the ball as long as it is not holding or rolling
                over the body and touched only once in any part of the body.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>16.</b> If a player entered 'no' as his availability for a particular game day during registration, he can not play on that day even though he is available now for that day. 
                Please note that the captains made their decisions based on the availability of the players at the registration.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>17.</b> A player can not play as a substitute player for any other team due to the same reason stated in #16.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>18.</b> There is an “Attack line” (solid white line) at 10 ft from the net on each side. “Back Row” players behind the line are not allowed to cross the “Attack line” and  Spike/Block. 
                If the “Back Row” players want to Spike/Block, it must be done from behind the “Attack line”. Touching or crossing the “Attack line” during Spiking/Blocking is a violation. 
                It is, however, permissible for a Spiker to land on or cross the “Attack line” after jumping from behind the “Attack line”. 
                The back row players can return a ball normally (not by spiking/setting/blocking) after crossing the attack line, but strictly following the Rule #8 above.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>19.</b> Captains have decided to make the carrying/holding rule a bit lenient this year (2023), so the referees will be instructed to become a little bit lenient for carrying/holding cases. 
                The referee's call will be the final call on this matter.

                <div className="marginVertical">
                    <b>1. </b>
                    The teams which have more than 6 players, they MUST substitute the extra player at the
                    12th point when the teams are changing the court sides. This ensures participation of everyone in the community.
                    No substitution allowed at any other time unless there is valid reason during the game such as serious injury and
                    unable to play during the game.

                <div className="marginVertical">
                    <b>2. </b>
                    For a valid injury anyone can leave the game regardless of any number of player teams. 
                    Rest is not allowed if your team has less than or equal to 6 players (say, 1 already left for injury in a 7-player team). 
                    Rest is the only option for a 7-player team for the 2 players who are switching at 12 points. 
                    Say, Rahim and Karim are switching at 12 points. Rahim started the game. 
                    At the first 12th point during the court side change Karim will replace Rahim’s position and Rahim will go outside the court.

                    <b>3. </b>
                    Captain can choose to play with 6 players if his 7th player is unable to play (of course need a valid reason for being not able to play). 
                    For a 7-player team, say if 5th pick is not able to play for a valid reason, 
                    then Captain can choose to get a replacement from another team from another group as per swap rule described in swap section. 
                    Same rule applies for any number of players in the team.

                    <b>4. </b>
                    Say your team has 7 players. In the game, your 6th player is serving the ball and the opponent gets the 12th point, 
                    so at this point court side change happens and your 7th player replaces 6th player in the serving position 
                    but he won't get the serve at that point since your 6th player just served in that position. 
                    However, your 7th player can serve the next time after rotations.
                </div>

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Swap:
            </div>

            In case a player does not show up or gets injured, 
            the team could use a substitute player (from lesser rank from his round or from a following round) 
            from the other group to make up for the injured player or the team may choose to play without the injured player. 
            If the injured player was the last pick, then the substitute player for him will be from the last 3 lowest ranked 
            picks from the other group. Injured players will be allowed to come back at any time. 
            If a captain is not available to play due to an unavoidable reason, 
            the drafted players will select a captain among them. 
            A substitute player cannot be the captain of that team. 
            However, the team can take any available non-captain player from the 2nd round from the other group as a 
            substitute for their captain's substitute.

                <b>1.</b> Any physical contact with the net is not permitted. Keep clear, stay away from the net.
                This is because players start to become too clingy to the net;
                almost to a point of shoving themselves into the opposite side!
                Not nice; not allowed. Touch the ball, avoid the net like plague.
