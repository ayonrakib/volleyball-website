                2022 Austin-Bangladeshi Volleyball Tournament Rules
            </div>


            The rules of play for the tournament will be governed by the following:

            Players will participate in the tournament in the spirit of sportsmanship and will conduct
            themselves in the best manner possible.

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Communication:
            </div>

            Games will be refereed by volunteer and/or paid tournament officials. All calls by the
            officials are final. No arguing. It’s for fun! In no circumstances, players are allowed to taunt,
            abuse, or hit the referees of the game. Such player(s) will be immediately thrown out of the
            game.

            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
                Rule of the Game:
            </div>
            
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>1.</b>   It is preferable that each group game starts & finishes in parallel.
            </div>
            
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>2.</b> The server has 10 seconds to begin the serve from the time the official signals the serve.
            </div>
            
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>3.</b> Referee will have a flag & not whistle; to avoid audio-confusion. So be mindful to serve/receive upon the signal of the ref.
            </div>
            
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>4.</b> Games are played to 25 points. There will be no side-out. Each service will constitute a
            point. Court-swap after reaching 12 points by any team. This is to be fair with light/court
            orientation advantage/disadvantage.
            </div>
    
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>5.</b> If the score is 24-24 by any case, the deciding factor would be whoever wins by back-to-back two points. 
            If a team loses the advantage and gets drawn again, the same situation applies-winning by two back-to-back points.
            </div>
           
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>6.</b> During league games, the two semifinalist from each group will be determined based on
                the highest number of games won by each team. 
                If two or more teams end up winning the same number of games, then team having more point difference i.e., 
                points scored minus points against, moves to the semifinal .
                For example, if the scores for Team A are: 25-21, 25- 20, 25-10, 24-25, 23-25, and 15-25; 
                and the scores for Team B are: 25-20, 25-19, 25-19, 20- 25, 24-25, and 20-25; 
                then the sum of point difference for Team A is 11 (=4+5+15-1-2-10) and 
                the sum of point difference for Team B is 6 (=5+6+6-5-1-5). 
                Based on this example, Team A will go to the semifinal. 
                If the point difference also becomes equal, then the teams won in head to head games within the group will move to the semifinal.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>7.</b> Game officials will track server serial (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Players must rotate clockwise at
                every new service to allow all the players an equal opportunity for the location advantages.
            </div>
           
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>8.</b> While the ball is on the air, players can change their locations if they wish (generally the way we play every week here in Austin); 
                however, in no cases a player from the second row should take a constant place at the net while the ball is on the air. 
                Let’s make the tournament more enjoyable to everyone.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>9.</b> A “let” serve that clears the net is considered acceptable. 
                A “let” serve in volleyball occurs when the delivered ball hits the top of the net, 
                but still makes it over the net and to the opponent’s side.
            </div>
            
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>10.</b> The server’s feet may not touch the court lines until the ball is released (while serving);
                otherwise his team will lose a point.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>11.</b> A team is allowed one minimum and three maximum successive contacts to return the ball.
            </div>
          
            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>12.</b> A block is allowed in the games. After blocking, the same player can hit the ball again 
                (i.e., in this case one person can touch the ball two times successively, 
                once during blocking and then after the blocking is done). 
                After blocking maximum 3 more contacts can be made by the blocking team while the ball is on the blocking side.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>13.</b>  A 3 member’s rule committee will provide further clarification to referee if need be and
                their decision will be final.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>14.</b> A ball is out if it touches the antenna, the post, side structure/screen, or the roof/roof
                features. A ball is also out if it comes outside of the antenna.
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <b>15.</b> Any part of the body is allowed for returning the ball as long as it is not holding or rolling
                over the body and touched only once in any part of the body.
            </div>
          
            <div className="boldFont marginVertical">
            Swap:
            </div>
          

            In case a player does not show up or gets injured, the team could use a substitute player
            (from lesser rank from his round or from a following round) from the other group to make up
            for the injured player or the team may choose to play without the injured player. If the injured
            player was the last pick, then the substitute player for him will be from the last 3 lowest ranked
            pick from the other group. Injured players will be allowed to come back at any time. If a captain
            is not available to play due to an unavoidable reason, the drafted players will select a captain
            among them. A substitute player cannot be the captain of that team. However, the team can
            take any available non-captain player from the other group as a substitute for their captain.

            Violations:

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>1.</b> Any physical contact with the net is not permitted. Keep clear, stay away from the net. 
                This is because players start to become too clingy to the net; 
                almost to a point of shoving themselves into the opposite side! 
                Not nice; not allowed. Touch the ball, avoid the net like plague.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>2.</b> Whoever touches the net first, his team will lose a point. 
                If both teams touch the net and it is difficult to decide who touched the net first, the referee’s decision would be final.
            </div>

            <div className="marginVertical">
                <b>3.</b> Crossing your hand(s) over the net is allowed for blocking only.
                However, interrupting opposite team’s ball by crossing over the net before 3 touch (by the opposite team) is not
                allowed.

                <b>11.</b>  A maximum of 6 players will be allowed to play in the court from each team during any

                available. If a team consists of more than 6 players, the captain of that team must allow each player to play 
                at least two games (by rotation or solely) during the league games. 
                It is encouraged that the captains should follow the same minimum two-game play rule for each player
