            The rules of play for the tournament will be governed by the following:

            Players will participate in the tournament in the spirit of sportsmanship and will conduct
            themselves in the best manner possible.

            </div>

            Games will be refereed by volunteer and/or paid tournament officials. All calls by the
            officials are final. No arguing. It’s for fun! In no circumstances, players are allowed to taunt,
            abuse, or hit the referees of the game. Such player(s) will be immediately thrown out of the
            game.

                (least skillful). An average ranking will develop for each captain out of the ranking numbers assigned. 
                The lowest average number will be the No. 1 captain and highest average number will be the No. 16 captain. 
                The ranking process should be extremely confidential, so from the Org Committee, 
                non captain Tarek will prepare the average ranking. Each captain will send their ranking to Tarek individually and 
                Tarek will publish only the average ranking to the Captains Group. 
                Now, for the first round, without lottery, Captain No. 16 will get No 1 pick, Captain 15 will get No. 2 pick, ……., 
                Captain 1 will get No. 16 pick.

                If two or more teams end up winning the same number of games, then team having more point difference i.e., 
                points scored minus points against, moves to the semifinal .
                For example, if the scores for Team A are: 25-21, 25- 20, 25-10, 24-25, 23-25, and 15-25;

                the sum of point difference for Team B is 6 (=5+6+6-5-1-5). 
                Based on this example, Team A will go to the semifinal.

                            At first 12th point during the court side change Karim will replace Rahim’s position and

            (from lesser rank from his round or from a following round) from the other group to make up
            for the injured player or the team may choose to play without the injured player. If the injured
            player was the last pick, then the substitute player for him will be from the last 3 lowest ranked
            pick from the other group. Injured players will be allowed to come back at any time. If a captain
            is not available to play due to an unavoidable reason, the drafted players will select a captain
            among them. A substitute player cannot be the captain of that team. However, the captain can
            take any available non-captain player from the 2nd pick from the other group as a substitute for their captain's substitute.
